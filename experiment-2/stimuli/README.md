# Map stimuli for the experiment

The stimuli consist of 60 cities in the US, spread out over the lower 48 states.
Half of these are big cities (population of 100,000 or more); the other half are small cities (population of 5,000 or less).

Cities were selected from a database of 36651 US cities (https://simplemaps.com/static/data/us-cities/uscitiesv1.4.csv).

All cities had a name that was a single word with no special characters and no more than 8 letters. The small cities had no more than 5000 inhabitants and shared their name with at least 4 other such cities. The large cities had at least 100,000 inhabitants.


The stimulus set used in Experiment 2 (`set C`) did not have any items in common with the stimulus sets used in Experiment 1 (`set 1` and `set 2`).
